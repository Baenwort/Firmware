# Firmware
This is the new repo where we will store all firmware for our machines rather than being in each machine repo seperately, as many machines use similar firmware with slight configuration changes.

This firmware is based off of Repetier Firmware, through many years and versions, as well as some integration with features of marlin and other work.
